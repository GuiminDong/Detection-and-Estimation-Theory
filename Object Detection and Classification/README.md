There are theer objects: objects1.png, objects2.png and firealarm.jpg.  

objects1.png and objects2.png show geometrical shapes of different
colors against a black background.  Objects1 has two different colors
plus the black background.  Objects2 has four colors plus background.

firealarm.jpg is a picture of a fire alarm switch
on a wall.  The dominant colors are the red fire 
alarm switch and the white wall.

For each case you are to write a separate program,

You are to design linear and quadratic Bayes classifiers
and apply them to these images.  You will need to select
training data from each of the dominant regions.  For these
programs you may use the Matlab classify command. 

Turn in a separate program for each image. Also turn in segmentation images,
one such image for each dominant color.  In the image the dominant color should be
in black and everything else in white.
